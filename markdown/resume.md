Experience
----------

**2023: Low-Latency Etherium Data Company (Stealth)**

* Cut version interval by half by consulting with team to implement test-driven development and agile practices
* Improved company's key competitive advantage as measured by Etherium data latency by mastering Ziglang from scratch to optimizing a 70,000 LoC codebase within a week.
* Cut RLPx overhead to 1% using LLVM and hand-coded AVX512 Keccak-256 implementation.

**Aug 2022-Jan 2023: Intel Labs**

* Sped up new-workload bechmarking 200x by sampling CPU performance counters to generate [SimPoints](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/simpoint_overview.htm).
* Achieved <3% CPI and <10% MPKI error while speeding up benchmarking by 10^6x using SimPoints

**May 2022 - Aug 2022: NXP Semiconductors**

* Developed semi-supervised learning-based ML algorithms, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in generalizing detectors to zero-day attacks.
* Collaborated closely with the VP of Edge Software in usability testing to streamline overhead levels, emphasizing optimum performance.


**Aug 2019-May 2023: UVA Computer Science Department**

* Unearthed two critical vulnerabilities in modern x86 processors, enhancing security and integrity, [published in ISCA 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499837)
* Applied formal verification techniques in Ph.D. research to harden machine learning models against adversarial attacks.


**Aug 2020 – Nov 2020: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab**

* Contributed to the PARADISE++ Project, spearheading the development of a memory subsystem for a parallel discrete-event simulator with C++ and Valgrind.
* Engineered an optimistically synchronized parallel discrete-event simulator memory subsystem, elevating project efficiency and output.

Selected Projects
-----------------

**2023**
:   LLM Quick Serverless Inference Project – Achieving Rapid Cold-Starts with Large Language Models

    - Implement fully general Upload-Your-Own-Model serverless inference using **FastAPI** and **Docker**
    - Achived cold-start latency 4x faster than [industry standard](https://www.inferless.com/serverless-gpu-market#summary) (15s, down from 67s-3m59s for GPT Neo 1.3b)
    - Also **AWS SageMaker** (compute), **AWS S3** (model caching), **Docker-Compose** (orchestration), and **Ansible** (deployment)

**2017**
:   Int’l Genetically Engineered Machines Contest (iGEM 2017) Won Best Model award by modeling genetic circuit behaviors and designing novel gene expression rate control methods.

**2017**
:   React-HexLife – [Conway’s Game of Life on Hexagonal Grid](https://devpost.com/software/react-hexlife)
- Developed a distinctive version of Conway’s Game of Life using a hexagonal grid, innovating on a classic concept using **React.js**
- Implement robust full-stack solution with **NodeJS** for backend development
- Revisiting and enhancing the project with "bun" framework
