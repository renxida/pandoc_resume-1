Experience
----------

**2023: MevLink (Informal Consulting for Low-Latency Etherium Data Company)**

* Cut version interval by half by consulting with team to implement test-driven development and agile practices
* Cut RLPx cryptographic overhead by 10x using LLVM and hand-coded AVX512 Keccak-256 implementation.
* Lowered data latency (company's key competitive advantage) for distributed Eth data system by 2x in my first week by mastering Ziglang from scratch to optimizing a 70,000 LoC codebase.

**Aug 2022-Jan 2023: Intel Labs, Research Intern**

* Achieved <3% CPI and <10% MPKI error while speeding up benchmarking by 10^6x using SimPoints, measured over SPEC 2017 x86 workloads
* Sped up new-workload SimPoint generation 200x by sampling CPU performance counters to generate [SimPoints](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/simpoint_overview.htm), avoiding simulation and instrumentation overheads.
* Use differential privacy to enable trace-sharing across organizational boundaries without concern for leaking sensitive IP.

**May 2022 - Aug 2022: NXP Semiconductors, Hardware Security ML Engineer**

* Achieved 85% accuracy rate in generalizing detectors to zero-day attacks on edge hardware by training unsupervised ML algorithms.
* Compared supervised and unsupervised algorithms for Spectre Side-Channe Detection, including VAEs, logistic regression, perceptrons, time-convolutional neural networks, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machines.
* Designed system in close collaboration with the VP of Edge Software for usable tradeoffs between detection accuracy and performance.


**Aug 2019-May 2023: UVA Computer Science Department, PhD Candidate (Exiting All-But-Thesis)**

* Unearthed two critical vulnerabilities in modern x86 processors, enhancing security and integrity, [published in ISCA 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499837)
* Wrote LLVM / MLIR compiler passes for discovering vulnerabilities and optimizing / studying Machine Learning Models.
* Applied formal verification techniques to harden machine learning models against adversarial attacks.


**Aug 2020 – Nov 2020: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Research Intern**

* Contributed to the PARADISE++ Project, spearheading the development of a memory subsystem for a parallel discrete-event simulator with C++ and Valgrind.
* Engineered an optimistically synchronized parallel discrete-event simulator memory subsystem, elevating project efficiency and output.

Selected Projects
-----------------
