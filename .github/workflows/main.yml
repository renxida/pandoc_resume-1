I apologize for the markdown syntax error. It looks like the indentation of the `container` section might be causing the issue. Try adjusting the indentation like this:

```yaml
name: Build and Upload Resume

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-resume:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    container:
      image: ghcr.io/mszep/pandoc_resume/resume_builder:latest
      volumes:
        - ${{ github.workspace }}:/home/app/resume

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build resume
        run: |
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}
          make
          
      - name: Upload a Build Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2.2.3
          with:
            name: resume
            path: ${{ github.workspace }}/path/to/resume # Specify the actual path to your resume file
```

This should resolve the markdown syntax error, and the workflow should work as expected.
